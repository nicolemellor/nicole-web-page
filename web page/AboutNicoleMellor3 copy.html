		<hr />
		<p>I was born on February 4, 2002. I was birthed at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware. I grew up in Bear, Delaware where seasons change depending on months.	
		I enjoy the changing weather here.</p>
		<p><b>I attended Kinder Care for my preschool and went to Christ the Teacher for kindergarten through eighth grade. I went to Padua Academy for freshman year of high school and currently go here. </b>
		At Padua,currently favorite subject currently is Psychology.</p>
		<p>I have been on the Padua volleyball JV team for the past two years now. In the past I have played softball and basketball, but I was bad so I quit. 
		I enjoy many hobbies like watching Netflix and eating.</p>
		<p>Listening to music is one of my favorite things to do! I listen to mostly rap, but I can go back and forth from country to pop to rap. 
		Music is something I can enjoy during various times of the day, even during school!</p>
		<p> <i> My favorite movie in The Notebook.</i> </p>
